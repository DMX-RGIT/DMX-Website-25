# ðŸŒŸ Hack2Infinity 2025: Where AI Meets Limitless Possibilities! ðŸš€

What an incredible **24 hours of innovation and AI/ML development**! Held at the **MCT's Rajiv Gandhi Institute Of Technology in Mumbai** from **March 25th to 26th, 2025**, Hack2Infinity brought together brilliant minds to push the limits of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The scale was massive, with **400+ registrations** from colleges across the country. After a rigorous initial screening, **21 of the most promising teams** earned their spot to compete in the final round on-site. The competition intensified with a critical **elimination round at 5 PM**, narrowing the field down to the **top 10 teams** who would battle it out for the top prizes.

### Guidance Under Pressure: Mentorship Sessions

Understanding the challenges of a hackathon, we integrated two dedicated mentorship sessions (**12:30 PM and 11 PM**) to provide expert guidance at key strategic moments. This ensured teams could refine their approaches and overcome obstacles, turning good ideas into great solutions.

Hack2Infinity was more than a competition; it was a platform for **collaboration, learning, and networking**. With complex AI/ML challenges that tested participants' skills and a **â‚¹1,00,000 prize pool** on the line, only the most innovative and persistent teams made it to the final showdown ðŸ’».

### ðŸŽ¶ Beyond Just Coding â€“ A Night to Remember!

Amidst the intense coding marathon, participants also got to unwind and recharge during a special **late-night jamming session** ðŸŽµ. Music, collaboration, and a shared passion for technology created an unforgettable atmosphere. It was the perfect reminder that great ideas are born when minds are both **challenged and inspired**!

A massive shoutout to all the **participants** for showcasing their exceptional talent, passion, and skills! And of course, a huge thank you to our incredible **organizing team, mentors, and judges** for their dedication and expertise in making Hack2Infinity 2025 a resounding success ðŸŽ‰.
