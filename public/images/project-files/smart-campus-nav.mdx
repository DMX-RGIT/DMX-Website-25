# Smart Campus Navigation

An augmented reality (AR) based indoor navigation system designed specifically for the RGIT campus to help students and visitors navigate efficiently.

## Features

- **AR Navigation**: Real-time AR overlays showing directions and points of interest
- **Indoor Positioning**: Advanced indoor positioning using computer vision and IoT sensors
- **Campus Map Integration**: Complete digital map of RGIT campus with all buildings and facilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates for construction, events, and temporary changes

## Technology Stack

- **AR Framework**: Unity with ARCore for mobile AR experiences
- **Computer Vision**: Python with TensorFlow for image recognition and positioning
- **IoT Integration**: Sensor network for enhanced positioning accuracy
- **Backend**: Firebase for real-time data synchronization

## How It Works

1. **Position Detection**: Uses device camera and IoT sensors to determine user location
2. **Path Calculation**: Algorithms calculate optimal routes to destinations
3. **AR Display**: AR overlays show directions, arrows, and landmarks
4. **Voice Guidance**: Optional voice instructions for accessibility

## Impact

- Reduces time spent finding locations on campus
- Improves accessibility for visitors and new students
- Provides real-time information about campus facilities
- Enhances overall campus experience
